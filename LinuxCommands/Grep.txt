grep
Ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/21033/how-can-i-grep-the-results-of-find-using-exec-and-still-output-to-a-file
1) find and grep together
find . -name '*.py' -print0 | xargs -0 grep 'something' > output.txt
Find all files with extension py, grep only rows that contain something and save the rows in output.txt

2) grep command
-n returns line number.

-i is for ignore-case. Only to be used if case matching is not necessary

$ grep -in null myfile.txt

2:example two null,
4:example four null,
